# Machine-Learning-Classifiers

A deeper dive from the project Simple Artifical Neurons, this project expands on the essential machine learning algorithms for classification and provides examples primarily using the library scikit-learn. First I initialized the Perceptron and Adaline models and then converted them into an algorithm for logistic regression. Next, I tracked overfitting through Regularization and then, used SVM's to classify different flowers and initialize the gradient descent version of Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and SVM with a default parameter. I then used a Kernel SVM to solve linearly inseparable data and to find separating hyperplanes. Next I made a decision tree. Lastly, I implemented a K-Nearest neighbors (KNN) model using Euclidean distance metric.
